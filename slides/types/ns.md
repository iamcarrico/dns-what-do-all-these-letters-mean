# NS Records

Name Servers

Note:
This is the DNS record where to find information for the rest of the domain. These will always be set with your registrar, and generally point back to the same place. They can also be pointed somewhere else. (e.g. registrar is Namecheap, while DNS is hosted on Amazon Route 53)
